## ü§ì Requirements
SatAllowance reqiuires a __Smart Card Reader__ and at least 1 __SATSCARD__.

### Smart Card Reader
Below is a quote from the `coinkite-tap-protocol` [README](https://github.com/coinkite/coinkite-tap-proto?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements). I hight recomend the __HID Omnikey 5022 CL__ which is available from [Coinkite](https://store.coinkite.com/store/nfc-read-b).
```
A supported smart card reader. In theory, all smart card USB CCID class-compliant devices should work. Our observations:

    ACS ACR1252U - okay and widely available, and for sale by Coinkite
    Identiv uTrust 3700F - reliable and looks nice
    HID Omnikey 5022 CL (not 5021) - fast, cute, and small
    HID OmniKey 5427 CK - tested Gen1 device, fast, reliable, must disable keyboard wedge via EEM interface on device at http://192.168.63.99/, when correct will identify as VID:PID 076b:5427
    NOT recommended: ACS ACR122U. It can work, and is widely available, but is not reliable.
```

### SATSCARDs
The __SatAllowance__ UX is centered around Coinkite [SATSCARDs](https://satscard.com/). Each kid should have 1 (or more?) SATSCARDs. See the list below for a few of my kids favorite SATSCARD designs üòÑ. The great _BTC Sessions_ created a [SATSCARD Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dc3RSZKGto) using Nunchuk. Coinkite also has a very comprehensive [FAQ](https://satscard.com/faq) that should answer any question you might have.
